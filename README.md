# Image-noising-and-filtering-using-CV-tools
# Introduction:
Noise in image is a random variation in pixel values which does not represent the true content of the image. It is generally an unwanted thing that stays in an image and can degrade the quality of an image.
# Goal:
The main goals of this assignment are to understand different types of noises in images caused by various reasons such as motion, light, focus, understand statistical variables like mean and variance, implement different types of mean denoising and image sharpening with different types of mean.
In this assignment we are working with 5 different types of noises which are:
1. Gaussian noise
2. Salt and Pepper noise
3. Poisson noise
4. Color noise
